Academic Library Book Management System – An Example
1. PROJECT OVERVIEW
Project Title: Academic Library Book Management System
Tech Stack: MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js)

2. PROBLEM STATEMENT
Academic libraries often rely on manual or semi-digital systems for managing books.
Students face difficulty locating books and checking availability.
Manual issuing and returning of books leads to errors, delays, and poor record management.
Librarians struggle with tracking inventory, overdue books, and user activity efficiently.

3. PROPOSED SOLUTION
A web-based Library Management System that allows users to search, reserve, issue, and return books online.
The system provides role-based access for different users.
Real-time book availability and status tracking improves efficiency.
Automated workflows reduce manual work and improve accuracy.
